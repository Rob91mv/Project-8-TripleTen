# Project-8-TripleTen
This project aims to predict whether a Beta Bank customer will remain with the institution or decide to leave. To accomplish this, we will analyze customer behavior data from the bankâ€™s database and compare both balanced and imbalanced predictive models to identify which delivers the most reliable results.
